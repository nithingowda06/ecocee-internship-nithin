## About This Repository

This repository is used to **evaluate candidates** applying for the **Ecocee Internship Program**.

This is **not** a certificate-based internship.  
This is **not** a guided training program.  

This **is real-world, self-driven engineering work**.

We are evaluating **how you think, structure, commit, and explain**, not just whether the code runs.
